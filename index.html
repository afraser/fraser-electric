          <p>This is a much overdue recommendation of Chris Fraser's electrical work on our home. He installed pendant lights in our kitchen, outlet for garbage disposal installation, and multiple light fixtures, including a very tricky and delicate dining room fixture. His prices are good, he is reliable and communicated well, and I felt very comfortable having him in my home. I have already recommended to other friends who have used him and highly recommend his services.</p>

          <p>Chris, was on the phone with me within seconds of my inquiry. He came out to look at the job the next day and was very thorough with his investigation of the problem as well as being up front with what needed to be done and gave a right on the nose estimate. I hired Chris because I felt very comfortable with his knowledge, professionalism, honesty, & flexibility to fit my schedule. He told me upfront that it was a two man job & even used wire that I had left over from previous work to save me money. He was on time Saturday morning completed the job in a timely fashion and discussed with me what he needed to do before starting the actual work. He also throughly cleaned up and took all of waste with him. He went over everything that was done with me and I am very happy with his work. Chris has an excellent personality and a real love for his work. I look forward to working with him again and will recommend to others that need a trustworthy electrician.</p>

          We needed to update some lighting fixtures - new chandeliers, pendant lights- and I didn't know anyone in the area, so I did a search online. The reviews for Fraser Electric were excellent, and accurate. Chris came by to look at the job, gave a reasonably priced quote, arrived on time, and worked efficiently. I would definitely recommend him!

          I am so pleased with the work done by Chris Fraser. His response to my call was timely and very polite. The work I had done in my new kitchen was very professional as was his follow through with the clean up. We are very happy with the service he provided and have since used Fraser Electric for the installation of two bedroom ceiling fans. Thank you for the prompt, efficient service. Great job!
